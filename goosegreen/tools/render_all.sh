# Render map scenes one at a time, then (optionally) assemble the full video. Safe to run in the background.
#
# usage (from the project folder, e.g. goosegreen/):
#   bash tools/render_all.sh [--assemble] "SCENE BASEMAP FIRST_TAG LAST_TAG" ["..." ...]
# example:
#   bash tools/render_all.sh --assemble "move3 darwin move3-1 move3-10" "ending isthmus end-1 end-2"
#
# Why this exists (lessons from the Goose Green session):
# - Renders started from a tool shell die with "render_cancelled_parent_exited" when that shell exits,
#   so this script re-launches itself detached (setsid + nohup) and returns at once.
# - Never wait with `pgrep -f "hyperframes render"`: it also matches other scripts' wait loops whose
#   command lines contain that text, so the wait never ends. We wait on the render's own PID instead.
# - Agents stopped by a usage limit can leave orphan wait/render loops behind; they are killed first.
# Progress: logs/render_all.log; per scene: scenes/NAME/render.log; finished marker: logs/render_all.done
